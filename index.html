              <p><em>Art Talks is a series of inspiring events intended to heighten interest and knowledge about art in its many forms. Experts from the local art scene and beyond offer informal and interactive presentations in various venues throughout Calgary.
The vision behind Art Talks, in partnership with the Rotary Club of Canada Tom Jackson Stay
in School Program, is to provide support towards the educational success of urban Aboriginal girls.
Art Talks gives 100% of all event money raised to the Rotary Club's Tom Jackson Stay in School (RTJSIS) </em></p>
