 <p>The mission of the RTJSIS is to positively impact Aboriginal high school graduation rates through mentoring, tutoring and financial support as needed. It is designed to encourage 'at risk' students to continue with their education.<br/><br/>
The program targets two high need areas of Calgary and provides financial assistance to selected Aboriginal students as a kick start to high school graduation and post secondary education.<br/><br/>
RTJSIS provides up to $1,500 per year, per candidate for Calgary Aboriginal students and supports them from grades 6 through 12. ($10,500 per student).<br/>
<strong>We hope to see you there!</strong><br/>
