ART TALKS

        This Art Talks event is the brain child of 6 local women whose vision is to support the success of our next generation of youth through education via the Rotary Tom Jackson Stay in School Program (RJSIS).
		
        Art Talks are evenings of intimate lectures given by artists on a variety of topics to educate, and expand awareness of creative talent and culture within our Calgary community.  The intention of each event is to raise money to support one more urban Aboriginal student within the RTJSIS program from Grade 6-12.  Each student that we support in the RTJSIS will require $10,500 total ($1,500/year for 7 years).


THE ROTARY TOM JACKSON STAY IN SCHOOL PROGRAM (RTJSIS)

        Art Talks is a series of events whose mission is to positively impact Aboriginal children’s high school graduation rates through mentoring, tutoring and general support as needed.  It was designed to encourage students from economically disadvantaged or dysfunctional families who might otherwise drop out of school to continue with their education.  The program targets two high need areas of Calgary and provides financial assistance, as a kick start to high school graduation and post-secondary education to selected students.
